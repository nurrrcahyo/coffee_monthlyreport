# Coffeeshop Monthly Report
## Monthly report for a coffee shop using Looker Studio

Using the same dataset I used in my earlier analysis project, I created a dashboard report with Looker Studio to show some KPIs and other interesting insights in a particular month. Although it's actually a data from a vending machine, instead of an actual coffeshop, I tried to picture it as it is a real coffeeshop.

For quick glance to that report, I provided the screenshot below.
